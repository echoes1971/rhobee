## 🎯 MVP - Priority Features

- [x] manifest.json to make it recognisable as a PWA


### Search & Discovery (NEXT - MVP BLOCKER)
- [ ] Advanced filters
  - [ ] Date range filter // Roberto: a generic range can be implemented, passing [_from_<name attribute>, _to_<name attribute>] in the metadata. These will be handled by SearchObjectsHandler that passes them to DBRepository.Search in the metadata of the search object

### Documentation
- [x] Easy steps to get the CMS up and running on your machine
- [x] Project description: brief description of the project, some how-to, feature list, history?

### OAuth Integration (HIGH PRIORITY - if not complicated)
- [ ] Google OAuth login // 👤 Roberto: YES !
- [ ] OAuth user creation with:  // 👤 Roberto: YES !

## 📋 TODO - Organized by Priority

### Security & Performance
- [ ] Token auto-refresh (file preview tokens expire after 15 min)
- [ ] Session storage/caching for tokens
- [ ] Rate limiting for file download
- [ ] Rate limiting for API endpoints (general)
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] Content Security Policy headers
- [ ] Rainbow table attack protection

### CMS Features
- [x] DBLink implementation
- [ ] DBEvent implementation
  - [x] basic implementation done
  - [ ] advanced: calendar view, compute recurring events
- [ ] Versioning/History for DBPage (track who modified what when) // 👤 Roberto: how?
- [ ] Draft system for content (save without publishing)
- [ ] Content scheduling (publish at specific date/time) // 👤 Roberto: simple fields with publish date start and publish date end?
- [ ] Bulk operations // 👤 Roberto: yes
  - [ ] Delete multiple objects
  - [ ] Move multiple objects
  - [ ] Change permissions for multiple
- [ ] Content duplication/cloning
- [ ] Recently viewed/edited list
- [ ] Favorites/bookmarks system // 👤 Roberto: nice to have, but requires db modifications

### OAuth Integration (HIGH PRIORITY - if not complicated)


### Rich Text Editor Improvements
- [ ] Custom CSS classes selector // 👤 Roberto: YES ! Let's customize the site colors at first (should be easy with bootstrap primary etc.). I'd like to have selectable skins for the public site, but that looks too much for now?
- [ ] Markdown alternative editor // ❓ where do we store the markdown, in the html field or another? if it's the same field, how do we distinguish the 2 in View and Edit?
  - [ ] Toggle between WYSIWYG and Markdown // 👤 Roberto: I love Markdown, I don't know why :)
  - [ ] Markdown preview
- [ ] Code syntax highlighting // I'd say "nice to have" (it will give a professional feeling to the end user), by now it seems redundant as we have a wysiwig editor
- [ ] ~~Tables support in ReactQuill~~ quill-table not compatible with the current quill version

### File Management
- [x] File upload progress indicator
- [x] Batch file upload (multiple files at once) // 👤 Roberto: yes
- [ ] Image resizing/thumbnails on upload (backend exists, integrate in UI) // 👤 Roberto: we have already thumbnails

- [ ] Quota management per user/group
- [ ] File versioning // 👤 Roberto: how?
- [ ] Preview for more file types (PDF viewer, video player) // 👤 Roberto: yes! how?
- [ ] Image editing tools (crop, rotate, filters) // 👤 Roberto: if easy. "nice to have"

  - [ ] Content statistics
  - [ ] Storage usage // 👤 Roberto: should be easy
  - [ ] Popular pages // 👤 Roberto: needs db support
- [ ] Audit log (comprehensive who/what/when tracking) // 👤 Roberto: not easy

## 🔧 Technical Debt & Known Issues

### File Storage
- Current: Flat directory structure per object ID
- Issue: Scalability concerns with many files
- Solution: Nested structure (files/XX/YY/ZZZZ...)

### Database
- Transaction isolation levels need definition
- Add indexes for performance (especially search)
- Consider migration strategy for future schema changes

### Error Handling
- Standardize error responses across API
- Better error messages for users
- Error tracking/monitoring system

### Code Organization
- Extract token management into custom React hook
- Separate API client from components
- Backend: Consider hexagonal architecture
